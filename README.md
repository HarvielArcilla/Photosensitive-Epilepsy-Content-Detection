# Photosensitive-Epilepsy-Content-Detection
 Python script for detecting visual patterns known to be common triggers for photosensitive epilepsy. Disclaimer: this is by no means an exhaustive algorithm for detecting triggering content for epilepsy, but it is capable of detecting rapid gamma and color changes within video files. This utilizes opencv, so it accpets any video files that are accepted by opencv. This program can detext pattern changes above 3hz, without flagging likely safe content. 
 
While this code is very limited, I hope accessibility-conscious programming like this is something I can emphasize more in the future. This was more of a proof of concept I hope to build on in the soon with methods of converting triggering content into safe content.
